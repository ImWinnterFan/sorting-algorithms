After reviewing selection sort and bubble sort from class, I reworte both from scratch and added comments to make sure I really understood how they work.
Now that i`ve grasped the basics, I wanna explore by changing parts of the code and seeing how it affects the behavior.

[Understanding Selection Sort]
I struggled to understand the algorithm and codes of selection of sort,so i ran the program and carefully examined the output to deepen my understanding.

1.[The structure of "for j in range(i+1.len(arr))]
At first, didnt understand why "range" had two arguments.Eventually, I realized they represent the start and end of the range.i*1 means the search starts 
from the next index after current posion, and "len(arr)" ensures the loop goes to the end of the array.This structure  allows the program to efficiently 
compare only the unsorted portion.

2.[The roles of "i" and "j" in the for loop]
I was confused about the diffrence between "i" and "j", but i leared that "i" controls which posiotion to place the minimum value, and it loops through
the entire array. Meanwhile "j" is used to search for the smallest value by comparing elements after i.

3. [The meaning of arr[i], arr, and "i"] 
・arr"i" refers to the element at index "i"
・arr refers to the entire array
・"i" represents the current index being sorted
By clarifying the roles of each variable, I was able to better understand how the code works.
